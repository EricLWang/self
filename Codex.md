## Contextualization 

### What is this?
I created Version 1.0 of this document on [Jan 12, 2017]. The inspiration came from [Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) and much of the formatting and wording has been heavily borrowed, on account of it being thoughtful and on the mark. I view this document as a medium through which to deepen self awareness, practice authenticity, foster personal connection, and leverage public accountability. 

### Codex Vitae 
The Codex Vitae (Book of Life) represents the sum of knowledge that an individual has accumulated in his or her life. Idea originally found in [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751) by Robin Sloan. 

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
My beliefs about beliefs.

- The purpose of this document is to explicitly capture my beliefs, allowing me to deepen my awareness and understanding of myself and the [perceived] world around me 
- Beliefs should be held with the utmost conviction, but also with an open-mindedness that permits change **[Strong opinions, weakly held]** 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- Sharing this document *[passively]* is a great facilitator for genuine connection. 
- Maintaining this document is a rewarding introspective endeavor.
- Externally recording my rules and beliefs frees up mental bandwidth. 
- This document is always incomplete and out of da -.

### Type 2: Existence and Reality 
My beliefs on the big picture and the abstract. 2A is about senses and biases, 2B about spiritual matters, and 2C about the world around us. 

#### 2A E&R: Senses
Personal constraints and biases.

* Any non-physical characteristic of a human being is **malleable** (and most physical ones are too). 
* Our minds and lives are run by stories, those we tell ourselves and those we hear from others. 
* We are constantly adding to incomplete models. 
* These incomplete models are treated internally as complete, which is as it should be. Healthy exploration of the incompleteness of our models is evidence of rigorous thinking, but too much can be paralyzing and anxiety-inducing. 
* Free will is an illusion, but it doesn't really matter anyways. 
* Nontrivial behavior change is drastically easier when the external environment is changed. 
* [False Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) is particularly dangerous as an underminer of compassion and complexity. 
* We will die. 

#### 2B E&R: Supersenses
Thoughts regarding spirituality. 

* Meaning is *created* subjectively, not *found* objectively. 
* Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life. 
* God as in the capital "G" entity from organized religion does not exist, but some other kind of higher power does. 
* Life is ultimately experienced alone. 
* There are no coincidences - everything happens for a reason. 
* "We're talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying through the universe" - Joe Rogan 

#### 2C E&R: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

* Time is only a useful concept to prevent from being late to appointments. 
* Multiple dimensions and universes exist. 
* Overpopulation is mankind's most pressing and challenging problem. 
* Aliens exist, and already know that we do too. 

### Type 3: Individuals and Systems
Beliefs that inform how I strive to live my life and how we should collectively strive to live as a society. 3A is me, 3B is we. 

#### 3A: I&S - Me
Individual themes that guide my life.

* Music is an essential part of the human life.
* Your word is your external value. Deploy it meticulously and give it earnestly. 
* Strive for **Quality** in work or play. 
* It is impossible to ever occupy any moment but the present. 
* Maximizing the number and duration of flow states in life is a desirible and important goal. 
* Drive towards productive friction. This is where growth is found. 
* The physical world around you is always better than the virtual one in your pocket. 
* Productivity/Effectiveness = **[Time * Intensity]**. This applies to both work and pleasure. Happiness and fulfillment follow a similar equation. 
* If viewing your relationships as a graph, the sum of **[# of edges * weight]** of that graph is a strong indicator for happiness and fulfillment, and should be prioritized. 
* Every stranger is a friend waiting to happen, until they prove otherwise [People are inherently good]. 
* Accountability is strongest in pairs
* Excercise is crucial for the mind. 
* One of the best things you can do is to give yourself advice as a 3rd party observer, as if speaking to a close friend. Then take it.
* Take your time and work hard. **Don't take shortcuts**. 
* Be Epic. 

#### 3B: I&S - We
How I believe society should be structured.

* Gay marriage should be legal everywhere.
* Abortion should be legal everywhere. 
* Marijuana should be legal everywhere. 
* Free college education should be available to all who want it. 
* The instinctive reaction towards the homeless should be compassion, not fear.
* We should all practice asking better questions. Small talk is lazy.
