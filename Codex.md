## Contextualization 

### What is this?
I created Version 1.0 of this document on [Jan 12, 2017]. The inspiration came from [Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) and much of the formatting and wording has been heavily borrowed, on account of it being thoughtful and on the mark. I view this document as a medium through which to deepen self awareness, practice authenticity, foster personal connection, and leverage public accountability. 

### Codex Vitae 
The Codex Vitae (Book of Life) represents the sum of knowledge that an individual has accumulated in his or her life. 

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am. 

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
My beliefs about beliefs.

- The purpose of this document is to explicitly capture my beliefs, allowing to deepen my awareness and understanding of myself and the [perceived] world around me 
- Beliefs should be held with the utmost conviction, but also with an open-mindedness that permits change [Strong opinions, weakly held] 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- Sharing this document [passively] is a facilitator for genuine connection. 
- Maintaining this document is a rewarding introspective endeavor.
- This document is always incomplete and out of da -.

### Type 2: Existence and Reality 
My beliefs on the big picture and the abstract. 2A is about our senses and biases, 2B about spiritual matters, and 2C about the world around us. 

#### 2A E&R: Senses
Personal constraints and biases.

* Free will is an illusion, but it doesn't really matter anyways. 

#### 2B E&R: Supersenses
Spiritual thoughts. 

* Meaning is created, not found. 
* God as in capital "G" from organized religion does not exist, but some other kind of higher power does. 
* Life is ultimately experienced alone. 
* "We're talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying through the universe" - Joe Rogan 

#### 2C E&R: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

* Overpopulation is mankind's most pressing and challenging problem. 

### Type 3: Individuals and Systems
Beliefs that inform how I strive to live my life and how we should collectively strive as a society. 3A is me, 3B is we. 

* I should always strive for Quality in work or play. 
* It is impossible for me to ever occupy any moment but the present. 
* A powerful and underrated tool is to give yourself advice as a 3rd party observer, as if speaking to a close friend. Then take it. 

#### 3A: I&S - Me
Individual themes that guide my life.



#### 3B: I&S: We
How I believe society should be structured.

### Goals
I don't currently believe in setting rigid long term goals, but here is a list of things I hope to transfer to the section above

* [  ] Publish a book
* [  ] Live in Tokyo for at least 2 months
* [  ] Climb Mt. Kilimanjaro 


### My writing
Stuff that I've written that means something to me. Embarrassingly enough, this section is currently empty in deliberate hopes that this scenario will incentivize me to change that. TBD.
