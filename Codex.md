## Codex Vitae

### Instructions

**If you are Eric:**

1. As frequently as possible, re-read your opinions.
2. At the beginning of each month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits. 
3. At the beginning of each year, archive the document. This [2017] is the first.
4. Around the new year every year, write a new yearly report. 

**If you aren't Eric:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me - the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the Glossary for a general intro of my favorite ideas, then come back and read through the Beliefs that seem interesting to you. 
3. Consider creating your own Codex. Use anything here that may be useful for you.
