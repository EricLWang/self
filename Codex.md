### Instructions

**If you are Eric:**

4. Around the new year every year, write a new yearly report. 

**If you aren't Eric:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me - the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Contextualization](#contextualization) for a general intro of my favorite ideas, then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Consider creating your own Codex. Use anything here that may be useful for you.

## Contextualization 

### What is this?
I created Version 1.0 of this document on Jan 12, 2017. The inspiration came from [Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) and much of the formatting has been heavily borrowed. I view this document as a 

### Codex Vitae 
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything I have learned in my life. If I lost all of my memories somehow, this could be something that helped me remember who I am.

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
Beliefs about beliefs.

- This document's purpose is to capture my beliefs about the universe. 
- This document's benefits grow in a compound interest kind of way, over time, as beliefs course correct over time, and build on one another.
- It's always incomplete and out of date. 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- I’m open to changing my mind at any time about any belief by evidence, persuasion, whimsy, or chance. 
- I believe beliefs are best categorized into four types: beliefs about beliefs (metabeliefs, i.e. this one), beliefs about perceptions (how reality seems to be), beliefs about the meaning of reality (opinions about how myself and others should approach life), and beliefs about the future (predictions about how things will be in the future).
- Making and maintaining this document is useful and fun. And increasingly rewarding over time. 

### Type 2: Perceptions 
How reality seems to be. 2A is about how my mind and senses seem to work, 2B is about my take on spirituality, and 2C is about how I think the external world can be best explained based on the information I have.

#### 2A Perceptions: Senses
Personal mental and physical abilities, constraints, and biases.

#### 2B Perceptions: Supersenses
My take on the spiritual and supernatural.

#### 2C Perceptions: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

### Type 3: Opinions
Beliefs about how I interpret my perceptions and synthesize the meaning of reality. 3A is about what this means for my own approach to life, and 3B is about how I believe society should be structured.

#### 3A: Opinions - Shoulds
How I believe I should approach life. These are all opt-in and apply only to myself.

#### 3B: Opinions: Society
How I believe society should be structured.

### Type 4: Predictions
How I think things will be in the future, based on the approximate year I think they’ll come true.

#### 4: Predictions: By 2016

#### 4. Predictions: By 2025

#### 4: Predictions: By 2030

#### 4: Predictions: By 2050

#### 4: Predictions: By 2100

#### 4: Predictions: By 2200
