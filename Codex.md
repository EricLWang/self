## Contextualization 

### What is this?
I created Version 1.0 of this document on [Jan 12, 2017]. The inspiration came from [Buster Benson](https://buster.gitbooks.io/public/) and much of the formatting and wording has been borrowed, on account of it being thoughtful and on the mark. I view this document as a medium through which to deepen self awareness, practice authenticity, foster personal connection, and leverage public accountability. 

### Codex Vitae 
The Codex Vitae (Book of Life) represents the sum of knowledge that an individual has accumulated in his or her life. Originally found in [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751) by Robin Sloan. 

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
My beliefs about beliefs.

- The purpose of this document is to capture my beliefs, allowing me to deepen my awareness and understanding of myself and the world around me 
- Beliefs should be held with conviction, but also with an open-mindedness that permits change **[Strong opinions, weakly held]** 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- Sharing this document *[passively]* is a great facilitator for genuine connection. 
- Maintaining this document is a rewarding introspective endeavor.
- Externally recording my rules and beliefs frees up mental bandwidth. 
- Some beliefs are organically synthesized without much conscious thought or choice, others are deliberately created and self-indoctrinated
- We have some degree of control over the ratio of the two aforementioned types of beliefs, and should exercise it to the fullest extent. 
- This document is always incomplete and out of da -.

### Type 2: Existence and Reality 
My beliefs on the big picture and the abstract. 2A is about senses and biases, 2B about spiritual matters, and 2C about the world around us. 

#### 2A E&R: Senses
Personal constraints and biases.

* Any non-physical characteristic of a human being is **malleable** (and most physical ones are too). 
* Our minds and lives are run by stories, those we tell ourselves and those we hear from others. 
* We are constantly adding to incomplete models. 
* These incomplete models are treated internally as complete, which is as it should be. Healthy exploration of the incompleteness of our models is evidence of rigorous thinking, but too much can be paralyzing and anxiety-inducing. 
* Free will is an illusion, but it doesn't really matter anyways. 
* Nontrivial behavior change is drastically easier when the external environment is changed. 
* Nontrivial behavior change is a hyperrealism + determination
* [False Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) is particularly dangerous as an underminer of compassion and complexity. 
* Enjoying your life is a choice. 
* We will die. 

#### 2B E&R: Supersenses
Thoughts regarding spirituality. 

* Meaning is *created* subjectively, not *found* objectively. 
* Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of life. 
* God (capital "G" of organized religion fame) does not exist, but some other kind of higher power does. 
* Life is experienced alone. 
* There are no coincidences - everything happens for a reason. 
* Though a complex experience/machine, life is an input-output machine, with drastically varying output horizon lengths. 
* "We're talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying through the universe" - Joe Rogan 

#### 2C E&R: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

* Time is only a useful concept to prevent from being late to appointments. 
* Multiple dimensions and universes exist. 
* Overpopulation is mankind's most pressing and challenging problem. 
* Aliens exist, and already know that we do too. 
* It does not matter whether or not we are alone in the universe.

### Type 3: Individuals and Systems
Beliefs that inform how I strive to live my life and how we should collectively strive to live as a society. 3A is me, 3B is we. 

#### 3A: I&S - Me
Individual themes that guide my life.

#### i. Growth 
* Productive friction is where maximum growth is found. 
* As soon as you think you're mentally / emotionally / spiritually ready for an experience that you think could have a transformative impact on your life, do it ASAP. 
* Maximizing the number and duration of flow states in life is a desirible and important goal. 
* Hyperrealism, Radical Open-mindedness, and Determination are the key drivers of velocity for productive change. 

#### ii. Mindfulness
* It is impossible to ever occupy any moment but the present. (Wherever you go, there you are) 
* Your character is not the person you are in those "special" or "extraordinary" moments, but in the most mundane parts of your life, when you're not even thinking. 
* You only have to be truly, intensely serious about a couple of things in life. Taking that to heart frees you to be silly, carefree, and fun-loving towards everything else.
* The physical world around you is always better than the virtual one in your pocket. 
* One of the best things you can do is to give yourself advice as a 3rd party observer, as if speaking to a close friend. Then taking it.
* Life only has the potential to be awesome and incredible if it is also sometimes shitty and horrible. 

#### iii. People
* Every stranger is a friend waiting to happen, until they prove otherwise [People are inherently good]. 
* A true friendship cannot be forged without conflict.
* Accountability is strongest in pairs
* Viewing your relationships as a graph, the sum of **[# of edges * weight]** is a strong indicator for happiness and fulfillment, and should be prioritized. 
* Instigate in a positive way. 
* Receiving love is far more difficult and just as valuable as showing love. Practice. 
* The people in your life are first, last, and everything in between, in different forms. 

#### iv. Producing Quality
* Strive for **Quality** in work or play. 
* Never compromise Quality for the sake of velocity 
* The best way to find joy and fulfillment is by constantly striving to add value to the people, places, and commmunities around you. 
* Productivity/Effectiveness = **[Time * Intensity]**. This applies to both work and pleasure. Happiness and fulfillment follow a similar equation. 
* Your word is your external value. Deploy it meticulously and give it earnestly. 
* Excercise is crucial for the mind and spirit. 
* Success is working hard / learning fast / treating people right. 

#### v. Reminders to Self
* Music is an essential part of the human experience.
* Courage, not confidence, is what is required to start - confidence is self-created after the fact.
* Saying and receiving no is a muscle that needs to be regularly and judiciously exercised
* The mindset determines the energy level
* Break one of your rules, and you're infinitely more likely to break all of them
* Own it or fix it.
* Have determination and persistence for the things you can control, patience for the things you can't.
* There are **very** few things in life worth getting stressed or upset about
* There are **infinite** things in life to be happy and appreciative about. Act accordingly. 
* It's okay, and productive, to be selfish some times
* Be Epic. 

#### 3B: I&S - We
How I believe society should be structured.

* Gay marriage should be legal everywhere.
* Abortion should be legal everywhere. 
* Marijuana should be legal everywhere. 
* Free college education should be available to all who want it. 
* The instinctive reaction towards the homeless should be compassion, not fear.
* We should all practice asking better questions. **Small talk is lazy.**
* People should show love, appreciation, and gratitude more frequently, and more intensely.
