## Codex Vitae

### Instructions

**If you are Eric:**

1. As frequently as possible, re-read your opinions.
2. At the beginning of each month, read the whole thing and make any necessary edits. 
3. At the beginning of each year, archive the document. This [2017] is the first.
4. Around the new year every year, write a new yearly report. 

**If you aren't Eric:**

1. Read this with the understanding that you are different than me - the way I live my life is not the way you should live yours.
2. Read the [Contextualization](#contextualization) for a general intro of my favorite ideas, then come back and read through the [Beliefs](#beliefs) that seem interesting to you. 
3. Consider creating your own Codex. Use anything here that may be useful for you.
