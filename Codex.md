## Contextualization 

### What is this?
I created Version 1.0 of this document on [Jan 12, 2017]. The inspiration came from [Buster Benson](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/Codex.md) and much of the formatting and wording has been heavily borrowed, on account of it being thoughtful and on the mark. I view this document as a medium through which to deepen self awareness, practice authenticity, foster personal connection, and leverage public accountability. 

### Codex Vitae 
The Codex Vitae (Book of Life) represents the sum of knowledge that an individual has accumulated in his or her life. Idea originally found in [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751) by Robin Sloan. 

## Beliefs

### Type 1: Metabeliefs
My beliefs about beliefs.

- The purpose of this document is to explicitly capture my beliefs, allowing to deepen my awareness and understanding of myself and the [perceived] world around me 
- Beliefs should be held with the utmost conviction, but also with an open-mindedness that permits change [Strong opinions, weakly held] 
- Some of these beliefs will be proven wrong. Some won't be proven wrong but will be wrong anyway.
- Sharing this document [passively] is a facilitator for genuine connection. 
- Maintaining this document is a rewarding introspective endeavor.
- This document is always incomplete and out of da -.

### Type 2: Existence and Reality 
My beliefs on the big picture and the abstract. 2A is about senses and biases, 2B about spiritual matters, and 2C about the world around us. 

#### 2A E&R: Senses
Personal constraints and biases.

* [False Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect) is particularly dangerous as an underminer of compassion and complexity. 
* Any characteristic of a human being is malleable 
* Free will is an illusion, but it doesn't really matter anyways. 
* We will die. 

#### 2B E&R: Supersenses
Spiritual thoughts. 

* Meaning is created, not found. 
* Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life. 
* God as in capital "G" from organized religion does not exist, but some other kind of higher power does. 
* Life is ultimately experienced alone. 
* There are no coincidences - everything happens for a reason. 
* "We're talking monkeys on an organic spaceship flying through the universe" - Joe Rogan 

#### 2C E&R: Explanatory
Science, politics, and the universe.

* Multiple dimensions and universes exist. 
* Overpopulation is mankind's most pressing and challenging problem. 
* Time is only a useful concept to prevent from being late to appointments. 

### Type 3: Individuals and Systems
Beliefs that inform how I strive to live my life and how we should collectively strive as a society. 3A is me, 3B is we. 

#### 3A: I&S - Me
Individual themes that guide my life.

* Productivity/Effectiveness = Time * Intensity. This applies to both work and pleasure. Happiness and fulfillment follow a similar equation. 
* Maximizing the number and duration of flow states in life is a desirible and important goal. 
* Music is an essential part of the human life. 
* The physical world around you is always better than the virtual one in your pocket. 
* Strive for Quality in work or play. 
* Every stranger is a friend waiting to happen, until they prove otherwise [People are inherently good].
* It is impossible to ever occupy any moment but the present. 
* Give yourself advice as a 3rd party observer, as if speaking to a close friend. Then take it.
* Accountability is strongest in pairs
* Excercise is crucial for the mind. 

#### 3B: I&S: We
How I believe society should be structured.

* Gay marriage should be legal everywhere.
* Abortion should be legal everywhere. 
* Marijuana should be legal everywhere. 
* Free college education should be available to all who want it. 
* The instinctive reaction towards the homeless should be compassion, not fear.

### Goals
I don't currently believe in setting rigid long term goals, but here is a list of things I hope to transfer to the section above

* [  ] Publish a book
* [  ] Live in Tokyo for at least 2 months
* [  ] Climb Mt. Kilimanjaro 


### My writing
Stuff that I've written that means something to me. Embarrassingly enough, this section is currently empty in deliberate hopes that this scenario will incentivize me to change that. TBD.
